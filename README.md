# Eoliann Business Challenge II ‚Äì Climate Risk and Infrastructure Damage Analysis

## üåç Project Overview

This project was developed in response to the Eoliann Business Challenge II with a focus on the strategic expansion of Eoliann's risk intelligence solutions into France and Spain. Our primary objective was to assess climate hazard trends, evaluate infrastructure vulnerabilities, and estimate financial impacts to identify scalable growth opportunities for Eoliann in new EU markets.


## The Challenge

- **Goal**: Analyze climate-related disasters (especially floods and wildfires) to inform Eoliann‚Äôs expansion strategy.
- **Scope**: France and Spain, with comparative insights from Italy.
- **Data Sources**: EMDAT, Copernicus, EEA, HARCI-EU, and Eoliann‚Äôs proprietary wildfire dataset.

## Solution

### 1. **Damage Assessment**
- Identification of the most and least impacted asset types (e.g., forests, roads, agricultural areas).
- Evaluation of vulnerability patterns by region and disaster type.

### 2. **Financial Impact Estimation**
- Estimation of losses by infrastructure category and disaster type.
- Highlighted that wildfires alone caused ‚Ç¨5.6 billion in damages.

### 3. **Tailored Risk Metrics**
- Developed probabilistic models to adjust event intensity and asset vulnerability thresholds.
- Identified high-risk zones and proposed preemptive strategies for risk mitigation.

## Key Insights

- **Wildfires** are the most financially destructive hazard, particularly in southern Europe.
- **Forests and agricultural zones** are consistently the most affected by natural disasters.
- **Infrastructure resilience** varies greatly: while roads and forests are vulnerable, dams showed strong resistance.
- **Business implications**: Insurance premiums, compliance costs, and asset protection are driving interest in risk intelligence solutions.

## Strategic Recommendations

- Expand Eoliann‚Äôs presence in southern EU regions with high wildfire incidence.
- Develop targeted solutions for transportation and energy infrastructure clients.
- Leverage new EU regulations and insurance trends to offer compliance and prevention services.
